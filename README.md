starfield
=========

To avoid doing any proper work, I'm wasting a night creating a hypnotic starfield.

View it at: https://joeiddon.github.io/starfield.

The only control is a mouse click which changes the direction of travel (arrow of time!).

If you want to play with star movement speed, then you will have to clone the repo and edit the code or just make temporary changes by modifying global variables via your browser.
